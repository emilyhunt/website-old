## About me

I grew up in the UK, and did my undergraduate degree at the University of Bath. In 2019, I moved to Heidelberg in Germany for my PhD studying open clusters in data from the Gaia satellite. It’s my first time ever living abroad -- and despite Covid-19, it has still been quite the adventure.

Being LGBT+, I'm fiercely passionate about improving inclusivity & equality in science for all. To quote the charity Pride in STEM, “Science does not happen in a vacuum.” The environment in which we conduct research can have a profound effect on the wellbeing of minority groups; anything other than complete equity and justice is not good enough.

Outside of astronomy, I’m also a sound engineer, guitar player and tea enthusiast. It's really difficult to pick a favourite tea; but I guess I drink Japanese green teas like [sencha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sencha) a lot.

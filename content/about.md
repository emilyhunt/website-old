  heading: Who am I?
  description: I grew up in Coventry in the UK, and did my undergraduate degree at the University of Bath. 
    In 2019, I moved to Heidelberg in Germany to begin a PhD finding open clusters in data from the Gaia satellite. 
    It’s a big move but it’s also very exciting! It’s my first time ever living abroad and is sure to be an adventure.

  description: I am a gay, trans woman (she/her), and am fiercely passionate about improving inclusivity & equality in science for all. 
    To quote the charity Pride in STEM, “Science does not happen in a vacuum.” The environment in which we conduct research can have a 
    profound effect on the productivity of minority groups. It is essential that science is a welcoming place, so that all minds can 
    flourish and achieve their best.

  description: Outside of astronomy, I'm also a big nerd about quite a few things - including music, sound engineering and loose leaf tea.
    I also recently started playing chess! Feel free to ask me for my Lichess username if you want to play some games.

Outside of astronomy, I’m also a live sound engineer, guitar player and tea enthusiast. My favourite loose leaf tea is the delicate and floral [Bai Mudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Mudan), a white tea from Fujian Province in south-east China (which I’m pictured drinking on the right.)

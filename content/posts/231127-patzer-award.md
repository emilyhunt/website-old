_Header image: a rare picture of me actually giving a talk (at the prize colloquium)_

This is a quick post to mention something that I'm really proud of -- [my paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...673A.114H/abstract) won [a prize](https://www.mpia.de/6083451/2023_11_Patzer_E)!

The Ernst Patzer award is given to young astronomers in Heidelberg for the best publications in the preceeding year.

My [catalogue of open clusters](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...673A.114H/abstract) won the award owing to its scope and impact, with 7167 clusters in a single catalogue.
